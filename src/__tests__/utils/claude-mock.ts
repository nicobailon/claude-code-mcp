 * Mock Claude CLI for testing

 * Each instance has:
 * - A unique mock binary name
 * - Isolated command logs and response files to prevent collisions in parallel tests
 * - Default failure mode for unrecognized commands
 * - Side-effect verification capabilities (file creation, etc.)
 * 
 * For parallel test execution, use getIsolatedMock() from persistent-mock.ts
